This CAN Controller was tested with the Bosch VHDL Reference Model and
passed all the tests. Because of the licensing issue it can not be 
published on the Opencores web site.

The Can Controller was also implemented in real HW (12 boards
were constantly talking to each other).

The included test bench is not a real test bench and should be improved.
However a volunteer is needed for such a job. I can provide some help
but am not willing to write it by myself.

Best regards,
  Igor Mohor
